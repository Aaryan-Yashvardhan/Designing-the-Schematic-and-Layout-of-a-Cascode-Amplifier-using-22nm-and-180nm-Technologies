Conclusion:

1. The project's results demonstrate that the desired gain of 26 dB (20 log 20) 
was achieved for both 180nm and 22nm technology files in a cascaded 
amplifier biased through a current mirror, as simulated in LT Spice.

2. We determined the appropriate ranges for Vbias and Vin values for the 
180nm and 22nm technology files to ensure that all MOSFETs in the amplifier 
circuit remained in saturation.

3. The calculated gain approximately matches the required 26 dB (20 log 20) 
value for both the 180nm and 22nm technology files.

4. Our ID values for both the 180nm and 22nm technology files met the 
criterion of having a Power Dissipation of less than 5mW.

5. The Unity Gain Bandwidth was coming out to be greater than 10MHz, 
satisfying the condition of having Unity Gain Feedback exceeding 500KHz.

6. The layout for the cascode amplifier was designed using Magic in 
compliance with design rules, then extracted into a .ext file and subsequently 
converted into a .spice file
