1. Project Description:
    - The aim of this project is to create special electronic circuits called cascode amplifiers and cascode current mirrors.
    - We will use different kinds of technology and computer programs to design these circuits.

2. Files and Folders:
    - There are folders named according to the technology used (180nm and 22nm).
    - Inside each folder, there are files for schematics (how the circuits are drawn) and layouts (how they look on a computer chip).

3. What We Did:
    - For the 180nm technology, we designed the full circuits in both drawings and chip layouts.
    - For the 22nm technology, we only designed the circuit drawings to see how smaller technology affects the circuits.

4. Layout Process:
    - We used the Magic tool to draw the chip layouts and made sure they followed all the rules for designing computer chips.
    - Then, we changed these layouts into .spice files that help us understand how the circuits work .
